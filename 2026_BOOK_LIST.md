## Thematic Arc of the Year
The 2026 reading list traces a powerful narrative arc through the landscape of human conflict:

- **Opens with martyrdom** - A priest's faithfulness unto death (Greene)
- **Builds through duty** - Military, civic, and personal obligation (Heinlein, Corey, O'Brian)
- **Explores fellowship** - Loyalty and brotherhood in battle (Dumas, LOTR arc)
- **Reveals spiritual dimensions** - The unseen war against evil (Lewis)
- **Culminates in sacrificial victory** - Grace breaking into despair (Simmons, ROTK)

Each book asks: What does it look like to do the right thing when it might cost your own life? What does it look like to choose virtue when cruelty and vice are all around you? Through stories of war, adventure, and cosmic conflict, we explore hope and heroism through the lens of Catholic faith.

## Image Generation Prompts

### Style Consistency Across All Covers
Based on the hero image prompt, all book covers should maintain:
- **Aesthetic**: Painted book cover art (not photorealistic)
- **Mood**: Heroic but contemplative
- **Color**: Warm and cool color contrast
- **Symbolism**: Subtle Catholic elements (crosses, rosaries, priestly figures)
- **Composition**: Multiple depth layers (foreground characters, middle ground action, background atmosphere)
- **Characters**: Faces showing moral weight and determination
- **Scale**: Epic scale meeting intimate humanity

### Books Needing Prompt Revision
The following books need revised image prompts as initial attempts didn't produce desired results:
- The Fellowship of the Ring
- The Mote in God's Eye
- The Two Towers
- The Screwtape Letters
- Hyperion
- The Return of the King

*(Issue: Prompts may have been too complex, wrong focus, or style inconsistencies)*

### Successful Prompts
- **The Power and the Glory**: Disheveled priest with sacraments, Mexican village, soldiers searching, divine light breaking through storm
- **Starship Troopers**: Young soldier in powered armor, transformation from boy to warrior, military starships, Bug silhouettes
- **Leviathan Wakes**: Detective and captain on damaged ship bridge, Rocinante against asteroids, conspiracy atmosphere
- **The Three Musketeers**: Four cavaliers with raised swords in X pattern, Notre Dame background, swashbuckling unity
- **Master and Commander**: Naval captain on quarterdeck, ship engagement, surgeon beside him, age of sail epic
