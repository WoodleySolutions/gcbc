**Video Description:**
📚 Our complete 2026 Catholic Book Club reading list is here! This year's theme: "War is Heck" — exploring human conflict to understand spiritual warfare.

Hi, I'm Tyler and Sadie from the Great Catholic Book Club! We're excited to share our 2026 reading list with you—11 incredible books exploring spiritual battle, conflict, and virtue.

Ephesians 6:12 reminds us: "For our struggle is not against enemies of blood and flesh, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers of this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places."

This year, we're reading books about human conflict to better understand spiritual conflict. All conflict is fundamentally spiritual—war is punishment for sin, as Our Lady of Fatima told the three shepherd children. By studying conflict in literature, we hope to become more effective in the spiritual battle we all face.

Whether you're interested in Catholic book recommendations, spiritual warfare resources, or classic literature from a faith perspective, this reading challenge has something for you!

💬 **Why This Theme?**
You can't be a bystander in the spiritual battle—if you're alive on earth, you're in it. We're the Church Militant. Through conflict, we either grow in virtue and become saints, or we don't. Conflict brings out the best or worst in humanity, and we want to learn how to let it bring out the best in us.
