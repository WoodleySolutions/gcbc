          The first thing to know about us is that the Lord has worked a powerful goodness in our lives. Everything else is a result of that first thing.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
          We live in lovely Iowa, with our four kids and zero pets (to the great disappointment of the four kids). We're both converts to the Catholic Church. Tyler was raised Methodist, and grew up on a working family farm in a super small town in Northwest Iowa. I (Sadie) was raised Muslim, and am a first-generation American child of Pakistani immigrants. I grew up on the Northside of Chicago.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
          Tyler was raised listening to country music, and his parents always had Rush Limbaugh's show on the radio. I grew up on hip hop, old-school Bollywood hits, and the sound of my parents yelling at everyone in Urdu. I'm not convinced that's very different from Rush Limbaugh.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
          Despite all the differences in our childhoods, we shared one very important thing in commonâ€”a love of books. Sci-fi specifically, but any good story would do. We made our worlds larger, and sought to understand ourselves and others through the beautiful lens of art. And we still love all kinds of stories, but now we get to enjoy them together and with Jesus Christ.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
          In our professional lives, Tyler is a musician turned engineer, and I was a fledgling academic now turned homeschooling mom. Tyler still loves playing music and I still love teaching and writing. Everything we are passionate about, and all the enjoyment it gives us, is poured into this website--our love letter to each other and the Lord. We hope you enjoy, and that anything and everything we offer here at GCBC helps you draw closer to the person of Jesus Christ!
