          The first thing to know about us is that the Lord has worked a powerful goodness in our lives. Everything else is a result of that first thing.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
          We live in lovely Iowa, with our four kids and zero pets (to the great disappointment of the four kids). We're both converts to the Catholic Church. Tyler was raised Methodist, and grew up on a working family farm in a super small town in Northwest Iowa. I was raised Muslim, and I'm a first-generation American child of Pakistani immigrants. I grew up on the Northside of Chicago.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
          Tyler was raised listening to country music, and I grew up on hip hop and old-school Bollywood hits. Despite a lot of differences in our childhood, we both loved 90s grunge and alt-rock, and we also shared a love of books. Sci-fi specifically, but any good story would do. We made our worlds larger, and sought to understand ourselves and others through the beautiful lens of great stories. Today we still love all kinds of stories, but now we get to enjoy them together and with Jesus Christ.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6">
          In our professional lives, Tyler is a musician turned engineer, and I was an academic now turned homeschooling mom. Tyler still loves playing music, and I still love teaching and writing. Everything we are passionate about, and all the enjoyment it gives us, is poured into this website--our love letter to each other and the Lord. We hope you enjoy, and that anything and everything we offer here at GCBC helps you draw closer to the person of Jesus Christ!
